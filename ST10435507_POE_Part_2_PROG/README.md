How the Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot Works?

1. Start the Chatbot – When you run the program, it begins with a greeting.  

2. Plays a Welcome Sound – A short audio clip plays to welcome the user.  

3. Displays ASCII Art – The chatbot shows a cool "AK47" design in text format.  

4. Formats the Console – The text appears in different colors to make it look better.  

5. Greets the User** – It asks for your name and responds with a friendly message.  

6. Chatbot Responses – You can ask cybersecurity questions like:
   - "What is phishing?"
   - "How do I create a strong password?"  
   The chatbot will provide helpful answers.  

7. Exit Option** – If you type "exit," the chatbot says goodbye and closes.  

8. GitHub Integration – The code is stored on GitHub for tracking changes and updates.
